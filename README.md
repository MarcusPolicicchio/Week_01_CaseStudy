**Business Activities**

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
NDAX is trying to solve the financial problems of briding the gap for Canadians between their current traditional financial system and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency asset class. They consist of Canadians who are retail and institutional investors. There is no market data on the exact amount of customers NDAX currently has, however on September 22 2020 they celebrated the milestone of $200 million of instituional trading. NDAX boasts many major advantages for Canadians using their exchange and dabbling into cryptocurrencies. They are incorporated in the province of Alberta as well as refisted as a Monet Service Business. This means they are subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering), Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and are applicable to regulatory framework of the Financial Transactions and Reports of Anlysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). This allows NDAX to meet their goals of engaging with regulators and setting the standard for Canadians and allows them several advantages being integrated in the current Canadian banking system. An example of this would be to deposit Canadian dolllars free of charge via etransfer, wire trasnfer and bank drafts. Users can then directly trade their fiat for cryptocurrencies, charging them a 0.2% fee. Compared to other competiters in this space, NDAX charges a flat upfrtont fee where other exchanges typically inflate

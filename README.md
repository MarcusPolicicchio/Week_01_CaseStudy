**Case Study of NDAX (National Digital Asset Exchange)**

**Overview and Origin: **
NDAX (National Digital Asset Exchange) is a Canadian Fintech company/platform that is a cryptocurrency exchange fully integrated within the Canadian banking system. NDAX was founded and incorporated in 2017 by Bilal Hammoud in Calgary, Alberta. Before Bilal began developing NDAX, he attended the University of Saskatchewan and received a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering in 2008. Bilal was a project manager for Volker Stevin Canada for 5 years before departing in May 2018 to fulfil his role of president and CEO of NDAX (“Bilal Hammoud - Linkedin.” Https://www.linkedin.com/in/bilalhammoud/?originalSubdomain=ca). NDAX raised capital in December 2017 through a seed round in which they raised $1.5 million to help fund development of their exchange. They currently receive funding and revenue through exchange fees of buying and selling. The announcement of a soft launch came on May 31, 2018, followed by an official live launch on June 23, 2018(“Crunchbase - Organization NDAX.” https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ndax.).

**Business Activities: **
NDAX is trying to solve the financial problems of bridging the gap for Canadians between their current traditional financial system and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency asset class. They consist of Canadians who are retail and institutional investors. There is no market data on the exact number of customers NDAX currently has. However, on September 22, 2020, they celebrated the milestone of $200 million of institutional trading (Asset Exchange Inc., National Digital. “Celebrating $200 Million Of Institutional Trading, NDAX Expands OTC Desk for Global Investors.” Celebrating $200 Million Of Institutional Trading, NDAX Expands OTC Desk for Global Investors, Www.prnewswire.com, https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celebrating-200-million-of-institutional-trading-ndax-expands-otc-desk-for-global-investors-301135342.html.). NDAX has several advantages for Canadians that use their exchange and are interested in being involved with cryptocurrencies. They are incorporated in the province of Alberta and registered as a Monet Service Business. This means they are subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering), Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and are applicable to the regulatory framework of the Financial Transactions and Reports of Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). This allows NDAX to meet their goals of engaging with regulators, setting the standard for Canadians, and are integrated in the current Canadian banking system. An example of this would be to deposit Canadian dollars free of charge via e-transfer, wire transfer and bank drafts. Users can then directly trade their fiat for cryptocurrencies, charging them a 0.2% fee. Compared to other competitors in this space, NDAX charges a flat upfront fee where other exchanges typically inflate the prices of their cryptocurrencies to hide the underlying fees. NDAX holds fiat in Canadian Crown segregated bank accounts, making them separate from NDAX operating capital and allows for better fiat control. NDAX is also partnered with Ledger and BitGo. They use industry leading Ledger cold storage with multi-signature technology to safely secure 95% of their customers cryptocurrencies offline and in a secure manner. This reduces the probability of a cyber attack on their users. NDAX utilizes BitGo to segregate their online platform from their cold storage for seamless interaction between offline and online cryptocurrency transactions. NDAX has also implemented Multi-Party Computation hot wallet technology. This technology requires multiple parties to perform mathematical computations to create and distribute shares which then come together to compute a public key. Another technological implementation is the use of third-party vendor assessments to ensure the highest security of user’s personal information and assets. NDAX hot and cold wallet providers are SOC 2, type 1 certified. NDAX also incorporates mandatory 2FA for all transactions and KYC to create an account (“NDAX - About Us | National Digital Asset Exchange.” NDAX, Ndax.io, https://ndax.io/about-us.).

**Landscape: **
NDAX is in the domain of personal finance, deposits, and online banking. NDAX can also be part of the capital investment domain, as cryptocurrencies can be viewed as an asset class to invest in. The personal finance and investment industry has rapidly evolved over the last 5 to 10 years. In traditional banking, there has been a large shift towards digital banking and eliminating the use of physical bank services. More specifically, the adoption of handling your financials in the palm of your hands with smart phones. There are financial and banking services that are purely digital without physical locations, such as Simplii and Tangerine. This allows users to seamlessly open and manage their accounts.  The introduction of mobile banking apps has given customers the ability to handle all their banking and credit card transactions in the palm of their hands. Innovations such as the introduction of e-transfer in Canada have enabled individuals to send fiat instantly at a push of a button. These innovations have also paved the way for a new age of digital investing. Services such as Wealthsimple allow customers to deposit fiat and invest into stocks using their mobile app, eliminating traditional ways to purchase stocks that involve human interaction. With all these great Fintech related innovations, there is one technology that is leading the way of innovation and its goal is to disrupt the banking and investing industries. This is known as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. This technology is best known in their crucial roles in cryptocurrencies, such as the first cryptocurrency created known as Bitcoin. Bitcoin maintains a secure and decentralized set of transactions which is paired with the innovation of blockchain. This helps guarantee and secure record of data and eliminates the need for a third party/middleman that is found in traditional banking services (“Blockchain Definition: What You Need To Know.” Investopedia, Www.investopedia.com, 16 February. 2022, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp.).  The rise of different cryptocurrencies has gained the popularity of the technology in Canada and around the world, creating a new market. This is where companies such as NDAX are trying to bridge the gap for consumers to be involved with holding cryptocurrencies and be part of this new ecosystem. NDAX is considered a leader in Canada as a cryptocurrency exchange, however there are also other major competitors in this specific niche. Wealthsimple is also a large company in this field. Wealthsimple not only provides access to cryptocurrency services, but provides users other financial services such as traditional bank accounts (like a savings account) and the ability to invest in traditional assets such as the stock market via a TFSA or RRSP (“Wealthsimple: Do Money Right | Invest, Save, Spend & File Taxes.” Wealthsimple: Do Money Right | Invest, Save, Spend & File Taxes, Www.wealthsimple.com, https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca.). Another direct competitor to NDAX would be Bitbuy. Bitbuy is very similar in nature to NDAX, however they are trying to take more of the market share of Canadians trading cryptocurrencies as they offer a more in-depth pro trading platform (“Buy Bitcoin Canada - Best Cryptocurrency Exchange | Bitbuy®.” Bitbuy, Bitbuy.ca, https://bitbuy.ca/en/.)

**Results: **
Since NDAX inception and launch in 2018, the company has been able to make an impact on Canadians investing and becoming involved with the cryptocurrency asset class. The best metric to look at when comparing cryptocurrency exchanges would be the total average volume being traded on the exchange. The average volume an exchange has signifies how popular the exchange is and ultimately more trading volume means more revenue for the exchange. When comparing NDAX to other Canadian exchanges, NDAX is the market leader in Canada in correlation to the trading volume. NDAX fluctuates between $4 million and $6 million in a 24-hour trading metric. In comparison Bitbuy, NDAX’s major Canadian competitor in the space, averages between $2 million and $3 million in trading volume. This means NDAX has a competitive advantage with how many users are actively using the platform. Despite these numbers, when you compare NDAX trading volume to other exchanges that focus on markets outside of Canada, NDAX is lagging. This is due to the fact that NDAX main priority is to focus on growth for users within Canada whereas other exchanges focus on worldwide users. Some popular exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Kucoin, Crypto.com and Binance all average over $1 billion daily in trading volume. NDAX is a new exchange that launched in 2018 where major competitors outside of Canada have been around for longer periods of time (Coinpaprika. “NDAX Exchange Statistics | NDAX Volume, Markets, Liquidity, Coins, Social Media | Coinpaprika.” NDAX Exchange Statistics | NDAX Volume, Markets, Liquidity, Coins, Social Media | Coinpaprika, Coinpaprika.com, https://coinpaprika.com/exchanges/ndax/.). For example, Coinbase launched in 2012 and Crypto.com launched in 2016. NDAX is expanding in a new Canadian market. This means the demographic for the amount of users NDAX can target is small in comparison. It is reported only 3.2% or 1.2 million people own cryptocurrencies (“Cryptocurrency Ownership Data for Canada 2021 | TripleA.” TripleA, Triple-a.io, 25 August. 2021, https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-canada/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%201.2,total%20population%2C%20currently%20own%20cryptocurrency..). As the popularity of cryptocurrencies rises and NDAX continues expanding and adding new features, NDAX will have a promising future. Over the years, NDAX will aim to compete with international and American based exchanges.

**Recommendations: **
NDAX offers many great services, however if I were to be apart of the development team there are a few services I would advise to implement. The first recommendation I would declare is a NDAX Visa Card. This would allow users to natively convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat on the exchange and spend that capital on a card that functions like a regular debit card. This feature would offer individuals to incorporate a part of their spending with NDAX and eliminates the need to transfer the fiat out of the exchange, which can be an attractive feature for many users. Crypto.com, one of the largest exchanges, offers this service to their users and has a rewards system where their users get cashback in their native CRO token. A new competitor in the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange space known as Shakepay is currently offering this feature to their users as well. Since NDAX is integrated with the Canadian banking system and focuses their efforts on Canadian development, the implementation of a Credit Card for Canadians would be a great addition to their services. Currently, exchanges do not offer any sort of credit card variation, only debit card. NDAX could be the first to offer this service where you would have the ability to pay off the credit card using fiat or cryptocurrency, as well as giving incentives such as crypto back (similarly to how majority of traditional credit cards have a points system). A technology that is increasing in popularity in the Fintech world that I would advise to implement for NDAX in the future would be the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI can be implemented for better user experiences and improved security. The development of artificial intelligent customer service can provide support to users for any issues that may appear at any given time of the day with fast response times. Since cryptocurrencies are quite new to Canadians, they would need support in understanding the concepts and how to navigate this new space. Offering AI advisors and support would bring value to an exchange in this new domain. AI is also being utilized in the Fintech world for security purposes as well to avoid forms of fraud. AI has diagnostic capabilities and can process sensitive financial data which can quickly determine any significant or suspicious activities that the regular user of an account wouldn’t make. This adds an extra level of security if there is some form of breach where someone obtains passwords to an account that isn’t a cyber breach (“How AI Is Affecting Fintech - Fintech News.” Fintech News, Www.fintechnews.org, 14 February. 2022, https://www.fintechnews.org/how-ai-is-affecting-fintech/.).
